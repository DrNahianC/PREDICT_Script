To use CME Script, you will need MATLAB. There are three folders:

"Gridloc" contains the Grid.mat file, consisting of the standard Grid Locations that were stimulated with the TMS coil
(see folder for specific details).

"Output" is where the processed data gets saved

"PREDICT_TMS_Raw_Data" is where all the raw data is kept. You will need to download all the rawdata from OSF 
https://osf.io/r3m9g/ which contains 8 groups of folders (sub-001 to sub-020, sub-021 to sub-040 etc.).
Once downloaded, extract all 159 subject data folders into the single "PREDICT_TMS_Raw_Data" directory

You should then be able to run the script by opening the MATLAB script and making sure the current folder
path is "..PREDICT_Scripts/CME_Script". This should be done automatically if the script is opened while MATLAB is closed.
