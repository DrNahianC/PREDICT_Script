This contains locations of the standard 1cm x 1cm grid that was overlaid across participants scalps for 
the TMS mapping procedure. Coordinates F was standardized to run along the vertex (Cz) in the medial
lateral direction, while the centre of 1 and -1 was standardized to run along the vertex in the 
anterior to posterior direction. This means that the centre of F1 and F-1 was standarized to sit at
the vertex (Cz) of all participants. 

During mapping, we positioned the TOP of the coil on the grid locations. As the centre of the coil 
(which is where there stimulation occurs) is 5cm down from the top, if we were to position the top 
of the coil at I3 (3cm anterior, 3cm lateral to Cz), we would actually be stimulating I8 (3cm anterior
, 7cm lateral to Cz). In this sense the furtherest lateral we went was 13cm lateral to Cz (every 
coordinate that ends in 8) and the furtherest anterior we stimulated was 9cm anterior to Cz (the
"N" coordinates).
