This is the directory for the EEGLAB and FIELDTRIP toolboxes. The current scripts call on "eeglab2019_1" and "fieldtrip-20200215", so if you have another version, you will need to update the script on the "add function" lines of Sensor_PAF_Pipeline.mat, Manual_PAF_Pipeline.m and Automated_PAF_Pipeline.m to the version that you are using. e.g. if you are using "eeglab2023.0", then change all references of "eeglab2019_1" to "eeglab2023.0". The required EEGLAB plugins are also detailed, including "bva-io1.5.13" and "firfilt".
